    Muse are an English rock band formed in 1994. The members of Muse played in separate school bands during their stay at Teignmouth Community College in the early 1990s. Guitarist Matt Bellamy successfully auditioned for drummer Dominic Howard's band, Carnage Mayhem, becoming its singer and songwriter. They renamed the band Gothic Plague. They asked Chris Wolstenholme – at that time the drummer for Fixed Penalty – to join as bassist; he agreed and took up bass lessons. The band was renamed Rocket Baby Dolls and adopted a goth-glam image. Then, it was changed to 'Muse' to represent protest. The band consists of Matt Bellamy, Chris Wolstenholme, and Dominic Howard. 
    Muse signed to Maverick Records and released their debut album, Showbiz, in 1999, showcasing Bellamy's falsetto and a melancholic alternative rock style. Their second album, Origin of Symmetry (2001), incorporated wider instrumentation and romantic classical influences, and earned them a reputation for energetic live performances.

      Absolution (2003) saw further classical influence, with orchestra on tracks such as "Butterflies and Hurricanes", and became the first of five consecutive UK number-one albums.
    They earned a reputation for energetic live performances. 
    Black Holes and Revelations (2006) incorporated electronic and pop elements.
     The Resistance (2009), loosely based on the novel 1984, and The 2nd Law (2012) explored themes of government oppression and civil uprising and cemented Muse as one of the world's major stadium acts. 
     Their seventh album, Drones(2015), was a concept album about drone warfare and returned to a harder rock sound. 
     Their eighth album, Simulation Theory, featuring a retro 1980s style, will be released in November 2018. 
     Muse have won numerous awards, including Grammy Awards, Brit Awards, and others.
