    Panic at the Disco is a band from Las Vegas. Their sound features various influences, such as electronica, rock, dance and punk. 
    Panic at the Disco formed in Summerlin, Las Vegas. Ryan Ross (guitar) and Spencer Smith (drums) were childhood friends. They started off playing Blink-182 covers, in various guises, 
    and then created the band 'Summer League' with Brent Wilson and Trevor (who has since left the band). At Palo Verde High School, Wilson met Brendon Urie and he was invited to play guitar for the band. When they heard him sing, however, he was instantly promoted to lead singer status.
