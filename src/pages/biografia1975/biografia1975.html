      <p>Straddling the line between hooky dance-rock and vintage adult contemporary sophistication, Britain's the 1975 found massive success in the 2010s with their distinctively arty, if still undeniably mainstream, pop aesthetic. 
          They fared even better with their sophomore album, I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful Yet So Unaware of It, which hit number one in both the U.K. and the U.S. and found them adding even more ambitious R&B influences to their sound.
        The members of the 1975 met in 2002 while attending high school in Wilmslow, Cheshire, a suburb of Manchester.
        They started out covering punk songs and playing at local all-ages shows before inevitably beginning to explore their own original material and trademark sound. In 2012, they released their first EP, Facedown, on the U.K

      In 2013, a third EP appeared, spawning the U.K. Top 20 single "Chocolate." 
      The band's popularity continued to rise as they continued to play shows across the U.K.
      The 1975 helped build the band's reputation in the States, where it reached number 28 on the Billboard 200.
      They returned in 2016 with their sophomore full-length album, the Crossey-produced I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful Yet So Unaware of It. Featuring the singles "Love Me" and "The Sound," it found the band moving toward a more '80s adult contemporary pop and R&B-influenced style. 
     The band now has three full-legth albums and is widely recognized over the globe.
